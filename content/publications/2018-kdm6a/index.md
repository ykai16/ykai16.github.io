summary: "We found that loss of the histone demethylase KDM6A activates a specific super-enhancer program, driving a distinct, aggressive subtype of pancreatic cancer."

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers. We investigated the role of **KDM6A**, a histone demethylase (an epigenetic eraser) that is frequently mutated in various cancers.

In this study, we discovered a surprising mechanism:
*   **Tumor Suppressor**: KDM6A acts as a tumor suppressor in the pancreas.
*   **Super-Enhancer Activation**: Its loss leads to the aberrant activation ("opening") of super-enhancers that drive a squamous-like, aggressive identity.
*   **Therapeutic Vulnerability**: Because this tumor subtype relies heavily on these super-enhancers (driven by BET proteins), these cancers are exceptionally sensitive to **BET inhibitors** (drugs that disrupt super-enhancers).

This work not only defined a specific molecular subtype of pancreatic cancer but also provided a direct therapeutic roadmap for targeting it—a prime example of "epigenetic therapy."
